/* 
Use your new JSX skills to recreate our team chart.

This app should have:
- The same header as the original.
- A table showing everyone's photo, name, and role (animals is a bonus).

All of the imports have been provided for you, including:
- Table data (team.js)
- CSS (styles.css)
- React logo (logo.svg)

In your JSX, you'll need to use each of the following at least once...
- className
- variable
- variable attribute
- self-closing tag
- map
- key

Feel free to have fun and experiment with others too!

If you get stuck or need help, please reach out on Slack.
