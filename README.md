# Exercise 05 - JSX

## What to do
Our goal is to recreate the team table that we worked with last week, but now with our new JSX knowledge! More specific instructions are available in the [App.js](./src/App.js) file.

Here's an example of what yours could look like:
![A heading that says "ReDI React Fall 2020 Team" followed by a table with the name, photos, and role.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26869552/92946444-f4399280-f456-11ea-9a32-405e85c71725.png)

## How to work on it
You can open this repository in Codesandbox by going to the following link where you add your Github username at the end:
https://codesandbox.io/s/github/redi-react-fall-2020/05-exercise-jsx-## Your github username ##

### How to check your progress
You should be able to see what's being rendered by the browser in CodeSandbox. If not, tell a teacher!

Within this repo, there is also an [`answers`](https://github.com/redi-react-fall-2020/05-exercise-jsx/blob/answers/src/App.js) branch that you can refer to if you get stuck.
